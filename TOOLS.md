# LemmaScript Tools — Internal Architecture

The `lsc` toolchain translates annotated TypeScript to Lean.

## Pipeline

```
TS source (.ts)
  → extract    (ts-morph → Raw IR)
  → resolve    (Raw IR → Typed IR)
  → transform  (Typed IR → Lean IR)
  → emit       (Lean IR → text)
```

## Three IRs

### Raw IR (`rawir.ts`)

Structured AST from ts-morph. Expressions are nodes, not strings. Has declared type references (`tsType: "Packet"`) but no resolved types. Close to TS syntax.

- `RawExpr`: var, num, str, bool, binop, unop, call, field, index, record
- `RawStmt`: let, assign, return, break, if, while, switch
- `//@ ` annotations remain as strings (parsed by specparser in the resolve pass)

### Typed IR (`typedir.ts`)

Raw IR annotated with resolved types and classifications. Produced by a resolve pass that runs once. Still TS-shaped, not Lean-shaped.

Each expression carries:
- `ty: Ty` — resolved LemmaScript type (nat, int, bool, array, user, etc.)
- Calls carry `callKind` (pure, method)
- Discriminant fields identified

Each statement carries type information for variables. Unsupported patterns (data-carrying variant equality, return in loop) are rejected here with source locations.

### Lean IR (`ir.ts`)

Lean-shaped. Produced by the transform from typed IR. Consumed by the emitter. Has Lean syntax concepts: `∀`, `∃`, `→`, match arms, `let mut`, `←`.

## Phases

**Extract** (`extract.ts`): ts-morph → Raw IR. Walks the TS AST, produces structured expression nodes. Only string outputs are `//@ ` annotation text.

**Resolve** (`resolve.ts`): Raw IR → Typed IR. Resolves types from ts-morph type info and `//@ type` annotations. Classifies calls. Identifies discriminants. Rejects unsupported patterns. Parses `//@ ` annotations with the specparser.

**Transform** (`transform.ts`): Typed IR → Lean IR. Consumes resolved types and classifications. Pattern-matches on `ty` to decide: constructor vs string, `.toNat` vs direct, `if` vs `match`, pure def vs method. No type lookups, no string parsing.

**Emit** (`emit.ts`): Lean IR → text. Trivial pretty-printer.

## Spec Expression Parser

The specparser (`specparser.ts`) parses `//@ ` annotation expressions into `RawExpr` nodes. Called by the resolve pass, not by extract or transform.

## Adding a New Feature

1. **Extract**: add the TS construct to Raw IR.
2. **Resolve**: add type resolution and classification for the new construct.
3. **Transform**: add a Lean IR lowering rule that pattern-matches on the typed node.
4. **Emit**: usually nothing.

## Scoping

The resolve pass uses linked environments (Scheme-style). Each binding is a frame with one name, one type, and a pointer to the parent:

```ts
interface Env { name: string; ty: Ty; parent: Env | null }
```

`let` extends the chain. Lookup walks it. No mutation, no maps, no copying. `resolveStmt` returns `[TStmt, Env]` so bindings thread through a block. Block-creating constructs (`if`, `while`, `forof`, `switch`) call `resolveBlock`; inner bindings don't leak out. `let x = init` resolves init before adding x to the env.

## Known Bugs

- **Discriminant check ordering**: the generic string-comparison branch in `transformExpr` still runs before the discriminant-specific branch for spec annotations (`//@ requires m.tag === "a"` → `require m.tag = .a` instead of `require m = .a`). Fixed for body expressions but not for spec expressions that go through `resolveExpr`.
- **3+ arm discriminant chains**: `detectDiscriminantChain` only flattens one level of `else if`. Three or more arms produce nested matches instead of a flat match.
- **Dead emission code**: `specparser.ts` still contains the old Lean-emission path (the `emit` function and `EmitContext`). No longer called by the pipeline.
- **Fallback escape hatch**: unsupported expressions in `extract.ts` silently become `{ kind: "var", name: node.getText() }`. Should error instead.
